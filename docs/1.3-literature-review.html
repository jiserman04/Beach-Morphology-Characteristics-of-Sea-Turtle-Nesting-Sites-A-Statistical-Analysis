<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Literature Review</h2>
<p>There have been multiple studies that have attempted to model sea turtle nest site selection. A beach at El Cuyo, Mexico was examined to see if beach morphological characteristics influence probability of a site being used for nesting. Lots of variables affect nest-site selection, such as beach slope, orientation, width, oceanographic conditions, grain size, humidity, pH, temperature, and sand compression. They used Spearman correlation analyses between the number of nests in an area and the primary morphological characteristics. The total mean slope and the mean dune slope were able to explain 85.4% of the variability in beach profile. The correlation between total mean slope and berm slope was the only statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlation. Green turtle nest selection was negatively correlated with the berm slope (r = -0.67). “Ordinary linear Spearman correlation analyses were made between the number of registered nests in the range and the dominant morphological feature in each of the 2 main components from the PCA to assess the influence of beach slope and width on the sea turtle nesting activity.” [1]</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to model the probability of a nest being in a location using beach geomorphology characteristics. This study focuses on Kemp’s Ridley turtles, “A correlation matrix of the variables revealed collinearity between the following pairs of variables: maximum dune slope and average dune slope, maximum beach slope and average beach slope, and elevation and rugosity. There was also a notable relationship between elevation and dune height, as well as between elevation and distance from shoreline.” “A model containing the aforementioned significant variables without elevation or distance from shoreline only had a pseudo R-squared value of 0.097, indicative that the variables elevation and distance from shoreline are the most influential for the top two models.” Each variable was significant in every linear model (p &lt; 0.001), and explained 40-46% of the variability. They state that they use “generalized linear models”. [2]</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to test if grain size of sand has an impact on nest site mortality, and to study nesting behaviors of sea turtles. Larger mean particle size is correlated with higher mortality. The number of trial nest holes and the mean particle diameter of sand were positively correlated using the Spearman rank test (r = 0.815; p = 0.0001; n = 20). “Average depth to the bottom of the nest was 85 cm (SD = 18.8; range = 21 - 155; n = 78). “When all 12 beaches were considered, a Spearman rank test demonstrated no significant correlation between mean particle diameter and survivorship (P &gt;0.05). But, when only the 10 biogenic beaches were considered, highly significant correlations were observed between mean particle diameter and median percentages of the following: emergence success (r, = -0.8424; P = 0.0011), hatching success (r. = -0.7939; P = 0.0042), mortality during pipping (r, = 0.7454; P = 0.0109), mortality just prior to pipping (r, = 0.6727; P = 0.0309), and mortality at earlier embryonic stages (r. = 0.7091; P = 0.0192).” [3]</p>
<p>“Total emergences and nest densities were correlated to beach slope and width in most cases. Steeply sloped beach sections had higher nest densities (r =0.83) and higher total emergences (r =0.86). Sand compaction or resistance showed a statistical correlation of (r =0.54). They state that beach slope is correlated to multiple off-shore factors as well, so it is possible that the turtles are using the off-shore characteristics to help them select a nesting site. [4]</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to determine the nesting variations of the green turtle. They include lots of p and F values. They tested the number of nests in different months of the year. From June to September, most of the nests were recorded in July, and the least were recorded in September. There were not statistically significant differences between years, but there were between months (F = 4.45, p &lt; 0.05). Certain beaches showed higher nesting probabilities (F = 14.07, p &lt;0.01). Certain areas contained more nests. For example, the dune zone included 1206 nests, while the sandy beach zone contained 419 nests, and the tidal zone only contained 29. “A one-way Anova was used for comparisons among monthly and annual nesting as well as the nesting site preferences.” [5]</p>
